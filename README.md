1. Open terminal/command prompt in the root directory of this project. 

2. Run "npm install" in the root directory and then run "npm install" again in the client folder. This would create a new "node-modules" folder in both places. 

2. Run "npm run build" in client directory to create optimal build. Might take some time. After done you would see a see a new folder "build" in the client folder. 

3. Run "npm start" in root directory to start server on port 4000 on local machine. You would see the message "Server listening on port 4000" on your terminal window. 

4. Go to "http://localhost:4000".
